# SourceryDemo
Demo project for the ðŸ”®Sourcery framework developed at Nodes - https://github.com/nodes-ios/Sourcery

I pushed everything, including the Carthage folder, so one shold be able to clone and compile directly without any problems. 

In order for the PaginatedSourcery example to work, you need to go to http://www.brewerydb.com/developers and get an API key for the BreweryDB API and add that to line 26 of `ConnectionManager.swift`.

This is the project I used in the talk I gave to CocoaHeads Copenhagen in May 2016. Slides at [https://speakerdeck.com/mariusc/taming-uitableviews-and-their-content](https://speakerdeck.com/mariusc/taming-uitableviews-and-their-content)
